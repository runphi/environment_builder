- environment_cfgs should be splitted in components-cfgs and network-cfgs and shoud be moved in the backend directory 

- Split defconfigs scripts per components as the compile scripts (with too many components it is difficult to remember the flags)

- Generate files in the install directory from the target configuration file during build_environment:  
    - Set board static IP based on the IP of the configuration file 
    - Set jailhouse_path.sh to export the directory indicated in the configuration file
    - Set jailhouse scripts for the target by reading the configuration file

- Solve the authorized_keys problem. 
    Problem: The authorized_keys file is loaded in /etc/dropbear/ instead of /root/.ssh and the user have to move it manually every time.

- Modify the scripts to allow multiple patches for each component. The patches must be configurable in the configuration file of the environment.

- Add MPSoCs emulated boards (Ultrascale+ emulation in QEMU)

- Add Components (Bao, Xen, U-Boot, ...)

- Add multi-architectural managment (x86, riscv, ...)

- Add new Boads support (ZCU104, Tegra, ...)
